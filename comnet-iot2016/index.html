    	Dr. Binbin Chen<br>

<p>ABSTRACT :<br>
Every year, billions of things in the physical world are connected to the cyber space through RFID tags, sensors, and other intelligent devices. New services are being built on top of this Internet of Things (IoT), which will change our daily life in fundamental ways. To support IoT services that require the information from a massive number of physical objects, people are developing foundational mechanisms that can enable things to connect and collaborate with each other in a scalable manner. This talk will discuss two example IoT building blocks ---- one for the approximate counting of RFID tags and the other for the computation of aggregate functions in a sensor network, and show how a communication complexity perspective can contribute to the design of near-optimal solutions for them.<p>

Dr. Binbin Chen is a Senior Research Scientist at Advanced Digital Sciences Center (ADSC), a Singapore-based research center jointly established by University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) and Singapore's Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR). His current research interests include the design and analysis of security-sustaining and fault-tolerant mechanisms for cyber-physical systems and other interconnected complex systems. Prior to joining ADSC, he obtained his PhD in Computer Science from National University of Singapore (NUS) and his Bachelor in Computer Science from Peking University. Together with his coauthors, he received the Best Paper Award in ACM SIGCOMM conference in 2010 for the work on efficient error estimating coding.</td>

<p>ABSTRACT :<br>
The rapid pace of urbanization and growing population is putting more
pressure on cities from the environmental, economic, infrastructure and
social perspective. There are many Smart Cities research programs around
the world that are developing solutions to mitigate these pressures.
The Singapore government has recently announced a major initiative to
be the world's first Smart Nation. In this talk, we will discuss the 
major research and technical challenges to realize the vision of the
Smart Nation. We present a holistic R&D framework to support the 
development of technologies and applications for the Smart Nation. We
also highlight our recent efforts in the development and deployment of
smart city-scale systems for various application domains in Singapore.<p>

            <h2><font color=Maroon><b>About The Workshop</b></font></h2>
            <p>Internet of Things (IoT) has been considered as an innovative and imminent information infrastructure enabling various machines, physical devices, and objects, denoted as things, to interact ubiquitously for environment sensing, information sharing and collaboration in intelligent and autonomous manner. Such technologies will act as a catalyst to the evolution of a new generation of services that will have a great impact on the social and technological eco-system. It can be envisaged that these next generation systems and services will encompass several domains such as e-Governance, Health Care, Transportation, Waste Management, Food Supply Chains, Energy \& Utilities, Insurance etc. New technologies and applications built on top of them must be developed in order to fulfil this vision of Intelligent Infrastructure. IoT poses a number of new challenges and opportunities for computing, networking, data management and analytics due to the large scale and complexity of such systems, and heterogeneity of the things and networks, constrained by limited resources of the things and the network.</p>
			<p>Encouraged by the good four successive years of ComNet-IoT in conjunction with ICDCN, the goal of ComNet-IoT 2016 is to provide an inter-disciplinary platform for researchers to exchange ideas, present results, share experience, stimulate new research, and foster collaborations among researchers, professionals, and application developers on the various aspects of sensing, computing, networking, information and distributed systems technologies for IoT, including back-end infrastructure such as the Cloud. Topics of interests include but are not limited to:</p>
       <ul>
        <li><b>Processing and Networking at Edge:</b> Sensing and sensor signal processing, sensor networking protocols, energy harvesting and energy management, crowd-sourcing & participatory sensing</li>
        <li><b>Middleware:</b> System and network architectures, middleware for heterogeneous sensors, devices & protocols, QoS provisioning, security issues: data confidentiality, integrity, network resilience, etc.</li>
        <li><b>Analytics:</b> Data management and analytics: data-stream, sharing, mining etc, business/machine intelligence from sensor data, deep-learning and related problems, social network analysis in IoT</li>
        <li><b>Infrastructure:</b> Big Data Storage, management and analysis, back-end (cloud based) infrastructure, distributed processing</li>
				<li><b>Applications:</b> Novel application developments and case studies in energy, healthcare, logistics and transportation, manufacturing etc, human behaviour modelling, test-beds and field trials</li>
       </ul>
			<br><hr><br>
					<h2><font color=Maroon><b>Author Instructions</b></font></h2>
