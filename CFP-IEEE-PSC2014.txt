SCOPE

The recent wave of sensor-rich, Internet-enabled, smart mobile devices has opened the door for a novel paradigm for monitoring the urban landscape known as participatory sensing. Using this paradigm, ordinary citizens can collect multi-modal data streams (e.g., audio, video, sound, location coordinates, etc.) from the surrounding environment using their mobile devices and share the same using existing communication infrastructure (e.g., cellular services or WiFi access points). The data contributed from multiple participants can be combined to  build a spatiotemporal view of the phenomenon of interest and also to extract important community statistics. Given the ubiquity of mobile phones and the high density of people in metropolitan areas, participatory sensing can achieve an unprecedented level of coverage in both space and time for observing events of interest in urban spaces. 

The Participatory Sensing and Crowdsourcing symposium at ISSNIP 2014 is designed to attract diverse participation from researchers and practitioners working at the leading edge in participatory sensing and crowdsourcing technologies. This necessarily covers a broad spectrum of topics, representative of the cross-cutting nature of the area -- from novel applications, to making sense of large-scale sensor data, to human computer interaction, to practical experiments. 

We solicit original and unpublished manuscripts on various aspects of participatory sensing, including (but not limited to) the following topics: 

- Novel smartphone-based sensing or crowdsourcing applications
- Participatory sensing, opportunistic sensing and crowdsourcing paradigms
- Middleware support and programming models
- Mining large scale multi-modal sensor data
- Intersections with cloud technologies
- Interactions between mobile devices and humans
- Novel user interfaces
- Energy-efficient sensing
- Activity recognition and high-level inferences
- User privacy issues
- Incentive mechanisms to motivate participation
- Assessing data trustworthiness
- Synergies between online social networks and participatory sensing
- Application deployment issues and experiences with large-scale deployment
